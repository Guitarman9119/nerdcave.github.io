# ðŸ˜Ž Introduction

Introducing the ultimate learning tool for the Raspberry Pi Pico! We created a series of PCB learning boards that will revolutionize the way you learn electronics and programming.

We understand that constructing circuits on breadboards can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially for beginners. That's why we've designed our PCB boards to be easily swappable and interchangeable, allowing you to focus on coding and learning MicroPython or CircuitPython without worrying about complicated wiring.

Our boards are perfect for students of all ages and skill levels, providing an introduction to microcontrollers that is both fun and educational. Each PCB Shield board is designed to focus on specific sensors or modules, with a series of lessons that teach you about the components, how they work, and how to program the Pico.

Once you've mastered the basics, you can choose to build the circuit yourself using a provided diagram, or use the board in your own projects. Our learning boards are the perfect way to get started with the Raspberry Pi Pico and take your electronics skills to the next level.
